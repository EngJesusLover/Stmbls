Ps 119:9-11 {
  9 How can a young person stay on the path of purity?
    By living according to your word.
  10 I seek you with all my heart;
    do not let me stray from your commands.
  11 I have hidden your word in my heart
    that I might not sin against you.
}
Therefore to remain pure, to not sin against Him:
  # live according to His word
  # seek Him with all your heart (plus mind, soul, strength)
  # Hide His word wihtin in you, in your heart

Be obedient (according to Peter's first letter): {
- you are chosen ... to be obedient (1Pe 1:2)
  
  This obedience means: {
    sober-mindedness (1:13-4:7, 5:8) {
      - minds that are alert and fully sober
      - set your hope on the grace brought to you when Jesus is revealed at His coming.
      4:7
      - be alert and of sober mind so you may pray
      5:8
      - Be alert and sober mind
      extra: resist evil one and stand firm in the faith
    }
    holiness (1:15) {
      - But just as he who called you is holy, 
        so be holy in all you do;
    }
    a deep love for others (1:22, 4:8) {
      - Now that you have purified yourselves 
        by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other, 
        love one another deeply, from the heart.
    }
    absence of malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander (2:1) {
      - Therefore, rid yourselves of 
        all malice (intention or desire to do evil)
        and all deceit, (action or practice of deceiving someone by concealing or misrepresenting the truth)
        hypocrisy, (practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform)
        envy, (feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck)
        and slander of every kind. (false statement that damages their reputation)
    }
    self-denial of sinful desires (2:11) {
      - Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, 
        to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.
    }
    submission to authority (2:13-14, 3:1-6, 5:5) {
      - Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority:
        whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,
        or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

      - Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that,
        if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,
        when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
        Your beauty should not come from outward adornment,
        such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
        Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
        which is of great worth in God’s sight.
        For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves.
        They submitted themselves to their own husbands,
        like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord.
        You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.

      - In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders.
        All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because,
          “God opposes the proud
          but shows favor to the humble.”
    }
    endurance of unjust suffering without retaliation (2:20-23) {
      - But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it?
        But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
        To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example,
        that you should follow in his steps.
          “He committed no sin,
          and no deceit was found in his mouth.”
        When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate;
        when he suffered, he made no threats.
        Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
    }
    treatment of wives with respect (3:7) {
      - Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives,
        and treat them with respect as the weaker partner
        and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life,
        so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
    }
    harmonious living that practices sympathy, love, compassion, and humility (3:8) {
      - Finally, all of you,
        be like-minded, (having similar tastes or opinions)
          be sympathetic, (feeling, showing, expressing sympathy or attracting the liking of others)
          love one another, (treat others with kindness, compassion, respect, genuine connections/relations, encouraging empathy, understanding, regardless of differences)
          be compassionate (feeling or showing sympathy and concern for others)
          and humble. (having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance / of low social, administrative, or political rank)
    }
    repayment of evil with blessing (3:9) {
      - Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.
        On the contrary, repay evil with blessing,
        because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
    }
    turning from evil to seek peace (3:11) [ref Ps 34] {
      - They must turn from evil and do good;
        they must seek peace and pursue it.
    }
    answering with gentleness and respect (3:15) {
      - But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord.
      ** Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
        But do this with 
            gentleness (quality of being kind, tender, or mild-mannered / softness of action or effect)
            and respect, (deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements)
                         (regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others)
    }
    offering genuine hospitality (4:9) {
      - Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
        (the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers)
    }
    using one's gifts to serve others (4:10-11, 5:2) {
      - Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others,
        as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.
        If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God.
        If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides,
        so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.
        To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

      - Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—
        not because you must,
        but because you are willing,
        as God wants you to be;
        not pursuing dishonest gain,
        but eager to serve;
    }
    rejoicing in suffering (4:12) {
      - Dear friends,
        do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you,
        as though something strange were happening to you. 
    }
    humility (5:5-6) {
      - (see above under submitting to authority)
      - Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand,
        that he may lift you up in due time.
    }
    and resistance to the devil (5:9) {
      - Resist him,
        standing firm in the faith,
        because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
