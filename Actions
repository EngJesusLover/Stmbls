Confess {
  Ps 32 {
    1 Blessed is the one
    whose transgressions are forgiven,
    whose sins are covered.
    2 Blessed is the one
    whose sin the Lord does not count against them
    and in whose spirit is no deceit.

    3 When I kept silent,
    my bones wasted away
    through my groaning all day long.
    4 For day and night
    your hand was heavy on me;
    my strength was sapped
    as in the heat of summer.[b]

    5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you
    and did not cover up my iniquity.
    I said, “I will confess
    my transgressions to the Lord.”
    And you forgave
    the guilt of my sin.

Repent vs Renounce {
  Renounce {
    - A list of things done (you, your family, reading list and tossing it)
  }

  True Repentance {
    - Truly change your mind about sin
    - come into agreement with God; don't donwplay your sins
        DONT LIE TO YOURSELF about your intentions. 
        (your spirit wants relief but Flesh always says for now, or until strength of craving become strong and overocome)
      - Many times we want relief of the shame of sin, keep the pleasure, remove the guilt, but not sin itself....
      - Don't play games 
        - Don't feed it
    - with repetnance
        YOU ARE DONE WITH IT
        Truly subjecting the flesh, not reviving it, or making provisions for it
        TRULY CHANGING YOUR MIND
        - not debating in your mind anymore
    - even if your actions have changed but deep in your mind you sitll have a struggle,
      Then YOU HAVENT REPENTED,
      you need to truly change your mind

    1) Respond to the conviciton of the Holy Spirit
    2) Realize your sins; confesss to God 
    3) Change your mind
    4) Renounce
    5) Resolve
      - Here is where discipline comes in, accountability, etc
      - changing your environment
      - Mt 26:31
          Watch and pray.
    
    sin is like an abyss
    - you walking near the edge of the hole of the abyss, that is temptation
      YOU MUST GET AWAY, DO NOT FALL INTO IT
      Flee from tempations

    don't debate temptation
      "should I" "shouldn't i", etc
      shouldn't even be a debate !
    - to overcome the addiction, truly make changes.

    ps 119:10
    - the WORD will keep you from sin.
      FEED YOUR SPIRIT

    Find accountability (one or two trustworthy friends)
    - tell them what you are struggling with
    - ask for help
    - and be accountable; apply them to your life
  }

  then truly walk in freedom; truly overcoming it.
