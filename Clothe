**Col 3:12-14**
  ~~~ CONTEXT: Col 3:5-11~~~~
  5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature:
    - sexual immorality, 
    - impurity, 
    - lust, 
    - evil desires 
    - and greed, which is idolatry. 
  6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
  7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 
  8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: 
    - anger, 
    - rage, 
    - malice, 
    - slander, 
    - and filthy language from your lips. 
  9 Do not lie to each other, 
    - since you have taken off your old self with its practices 
    - 10 and have put on the new self, 
      * which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 
  11 Here there is no 
    - Gentile or Jew, 
    - circumcised or uncircumcised, 
    - barbarian, 
    - Scythian, 
    - slave or free, 
    * but Christ is all, and is in all.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  12 Therefore, as God’s
    - chosen people,
    - holy
    - and dearly loved,
  clothe yourselves with 
    * compassion, 
    * kindness, 
    * humility, 
    * gentleness
    * and patience.
  13 Bear with each other 
  - and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone.
    * Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
  14 And over all these virtues
    * put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.

  Faith over Works of the Law, under a curse if maintaining Law but Christ liberates (v1-14)
  Promise (blessing of Abraham and his seed [Christ]) came before the Law (v15-18)
  Law for control of sin so promise given thru faith in Jesus, might be given to those who believe (v19-22)
  We were under Law, it was our guardian, UNTIL Christ came so we may be justified by faith and no longer be under a guardian (v23-25)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  26 So in Christ Jesus
    - you are all children of God
      ** through faith, **
  27 for all of you
    - who were baptized into Christ
    * have clothed yourselves with Christ.

	Rev 7:13-14
    13 Then one of the elders asked me,
    “These in white robes—who are they,
    and where did they come from?”
    14 I answered, “Sir, you know.”
    And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation;
      - they have washed their robes
      - and made them white
        ** in the blood of the Lamb. **

    14 Rather, clothe yourselves with
      * the Lord Jesus Christ,

  1Pe 3:3-4\
    3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment,
        such as elaborate hairstyles
        and the wearing of gold jewelry
        or fine clothes.
    4 Rather, it should be that of your inner self,
      - the unfading beauty of 
        * a gentle
        * and quiet spirit,
    which is of great worth in God’s sight.

  Mt 6:25
    25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; 
    or about your body, what you will wear. 
    Is not life more than food, 
    and the body more than clothes?
	
  Ex 20:26
    26 And do not go up to my altar on steps, 
    or your private parts may be exposed.’

	  Mt 6:28-30
      28 “And why do you worry about clothes?
      See how the flowers of the field grow.
      They do not labor or spin.
      29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
      30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, 
      will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?

	  Jn 10:23-24
      23 and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade.
      24 The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying,
      “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”

	  Jas 2:1-4
      1 My brothers and sisters,
      believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. 
      2 Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, 
      and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
      3 If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, 
      “Here’s a good seat for you,” 
      but say to the poor man,
      “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”
      4 have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

    Rev 7:9-10
      9 After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count,
      from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. 
        - They were wearing white robes
        - and were holding palm branches in their hands.
      10 And they cried out in a loud voice:
        “Salvation belongs to our God,
        who sits on the throne,
        and to the Lamb.”

Gen 3:21
  21 The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
